# GitHubTracker [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/EverythingC0DE/GitHubTracker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EverythingC0DE/GitHubTracker)

My first proper attempt on making some thing with [JQuery](https://jquery.com).

## Make it your own!

First of all, you going to need to know the basics of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) including [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)

When you finished learning the basics, fork this project then go into [index.html](./index.html) and change it to your liking, you may need to change [style.css](./css/style.css).

## Upload it!

Download [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org) and [Git](https://git-scm.com) then create a folder, shift+right-click inside. Select 'Open Command Window Here'. Inside CMD, type in ```git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAMEHERE/GitHubTracker.git```. When that's finished, open up [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org) login in to your website by a button which is located near top. Open up the folder, select everything by pressing on the top then holding shift and press the bottom, then drag it in to your website FTP.When you've finished all of the steps above, your now officially done.

## Important

In your website if you do have it uploaded, make sure you have my name on the page, anywhere for credits.
